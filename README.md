# Monster Valle
> Monster Valle, full-featured MMORPG based in PokÃ©mon made with JavaScript, NodeJS, PhaserJS, VueJS and websockets. 
> The current situation is that I want to rewrite the older release to new one with a better architecture.

# Secretly I'm doing a closed-source release of my game :)

The Old Game Client and and Old Game Server are avaliable here: https://monstervalle.onrender.com/

You can see the mechanics here: https://www.youtube.com/@monstervalle6316/videos

Notable features: PvP, Players Market Place, Quests, multiplayer real-time interactions, monster move learning and level up, party, items, storyline and etc.

In a creative solution, a "script language" was build on top of JSON to automate the gameclient/gameserver, most part of the game is full automated: level design, UIs, battle, network proccesses; personal architecture pattern was created to make the development and maintainability easy and clear. Edit UI in Photoshop and send it directly to game in real-time.
